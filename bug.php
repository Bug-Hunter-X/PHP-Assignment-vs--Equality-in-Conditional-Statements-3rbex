This code suffers from a common PHP error: using the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==) in a conditional statement.  This leads to unexpected behavior because the assignment operator modifies the variable, and its result is the assigned value, which is often truthy.

```php
<?php
$a = 5;
if ($a = 10) {
    echo "a is 10";
} else {
    echo "a is not 10";
}
?>
```

In this example, the `if` condition `$a = 10` assigns 10 to `$a`. The assignment expression itself evaluates to 10, which is considered true in a boolean context. Thus, the code always prints "a is 10", even though the intention was to check if `$a` is already equal to 10.
