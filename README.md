# PHP Assignment vs. Equality in Conditional Statements

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: using the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==) in conditional statements.  This leads to unexpected behavior and logic errors in your code.

The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail and operator usage in programming.  Always double-check your conditional statements to ensure correct logic.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.php` using a PHP interpreter.
3. Observe the unexpected output.
4. Run `bugSolution.php` to see the corrected output.
